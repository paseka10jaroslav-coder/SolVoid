  <p align="center">
    <strong>SolVoid</strong> is a high-performance, non-custodial privacy protocol that provides a decentralized identity-abstraction layer on the Solana blockchain.
    <br />
    It utilizes <b>Groth16 Zero-Knowledge SNARKs</b> and <b>Poseidon-3 Hashing</b> to deliver institutional-grade anonymity at sub-second speeds.
  </p>

## 🔱 Executive Vision

In the landscape of hyper-transparent blockchain architectures, **SolVoid** represents the critical transition from "Public-by-Default" to "Private-by-Choice." The protocol is engineered to neutralize the risks of on-chain telemetry, MEV-sandwich attacks, and transaction graph heuristics. By decoupling asset ownership from transaction history, SolVoid empowers individuals and institutions to execute sensitive financial maneuvers with the speed of Solana and the secrecy of Zero-Knowledge.

## 🧬 Deep-Dive Architecture

SolVoid is not a single tool, but a synergistic ecosystem of cryptographic primitives and on-chain state managers.

### ZK-SNARK Circuit Topology
Our circuits are written in **Circom 2.1**, employing a Groth16 proving scheme on the **BN254** elliptic curve. This ensures maximum compatibility with Solana's forthcoming ZK precompiles while maintaining current operational efficiency through our custom Rust verifier.

### The Poseidon-3 Hash Standard
We use **Poseidon-3**, a Sponge-construction hash function optimized specifically for R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint Systems). 
-   **Efficiency**: Reduces constraints from ~20,000 (Keccak) to **~210** per field element.
-   **Security**: Provides 128-bit security against all known algebraic attacks.

### On-Chain State Management
The SolVoid program manages a sliding window of **100 Merkle Roots**. This allows users to generate proofs against slightly older state, mitigating the risk of "Root Drift" where a proof becomes invalid because someone else deposited simultaneously.

## 👻 Privacy Ghost Score Diagnostics

The **Ghost Score** is the heartbeat of the SolVoid ecosystem. It provides an objective numerical rank (0-100) of your wallet's anonymity.

-   **Linkage Score**: Identifies direct and N-hop paths to centralized exchanges (CEX) or known identifiers.
-   **Temporal Analysis**: Detects "human" rhythms in transaction timing (e.g., repeating daily patterns).
-   **Volume Profiling**: Flagging of round-number deposits (e.g., exactly 10.0 SOL) which are easier to track.

```bash
# Execute deep-scan and generate shareable ZK-signed badge
solvoid-scan ghost <MY_ADDRESS> --badge --share --json
```

---

## 🔧 Command-Line Interface (CLI) Master Reference

The `solvoid-scan` CLI is a production-grade binary for privacy management.

#### Core Operational Commands
-   `solvoid-scan shield <amount>`: The primary ingress. Converts native SOL to a ZK-Commitment.
-   `solvoid-scan withdraw <secret> <nullifier> <recipient> <amount>`: The primary egress. Reclaims funds anonymously.
-   `solvoid-scan ghost <address>`: Generates the Ghost Score report and visual terminal art.
-   `solvoid-scan protect <address>`: Active monitoring mode for identifying real-time privacy leaks.
-   `solvoid-scan rescue <wallet>`: Atomic "nuke" option for high-speed mitigation of key leaks.

#### Global Flags & Automation
| Flag | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--rpc <URL>` | Override standard Solana RPC endpoints. | Mainnet-Beta |
| `--program <ID>` | Override the default SolVoid Program ID. | `Fg6Pa...` |
| `--relayer <URL>` | Target a specific Shadow Relayer instance. | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `--dry-run` | Perform an atomic simulation without spending gas. | `false` |
| `--json` | Output all results in raw JSON format for CI/CD. | `false` |

## 🛰 Shadow Relayer Infrastructure

The **Shadow Relayer** is a critical component for achieving network-level anonymity.

> **TIP**  
> Use the Relayer to avoid "Gas Linkage." If you fund your new recipient wallet with gas from an exchange, you have nullified your privacy. The Relayer solves this by paying the gas for you and deducting a small bounty from the withdrawal.

### Relayer Endpoints
-   `GET /health`: Node status and network metrics.
-   `POST /register`: Onboarding for new relay nodes.
-   `POST /relay`: The primary submission point for ZK-signed transactions.
-   `POST /encrypt-route`: Prepares multi-hop onion-routed payloads.

---

## 🚀 Operational Setup & Lifecycle

### 1. Requirements
- **Node.js**: v18.0.0+ (Recommended: v20 LTS)
- **Rust/Cargo**: 1.75.0+
- **Solana CLI**: Latest Stable
- **Hardware**: AVX2 support (optional, for faster local proving)

### 2. Deployment Flow
```bash
# Clone Enterprise Repository
git clone https://github.com/brainless3178/SolVoid.git
cd solvoid

# Install Critical Dependencies
npm install && npm run build

# Configure Environment
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Local Ceremony (Optional)
For highly secure local environments, run a personal MPC ceremony:
```bash
./scripts/run-ceremony.sh
```

---

## 🛡 Security, Validation & Testing

SolVoid employs a "Defense in Depth" strategy, validated by a massive suite of specialized shell scripts in `/scripts`.

### The Shell Script Index
| Script | Documentation |
| :--- | :--- |
| `./scripts/run-security-tests.sh` | **The Master Suite**: Runs every validation mentioned below. |
| `./scripts/verify-hash-consistency.sh` | Confirms Poseidon-3 parity across Rust, TS, and Circom logic. |
| `./scripts/vault-balance-protection.sh` | Simulates "phantom withdrawal" attacks to verify vault safety. |
| `./scripts/nullifier-validation-test.sh` | Verifies the impossibility of double-spending. |
| `./scripts/test-emergency-procedures.sh` | Stress-tests the speed and effectiveness of the Atomic Rescue. |
| `./scripts/arithmetic-safety-test.sh` | Probes for overflows and field-element collisions. |
| `./scripts/rust-dependency-audit.sh` | Performs a deep audit of the cargo dependency tree for CVEs. |

### Testing Lifecycle
```bash
# Run unit tests for SDK and CLI
npm run test:unit

# Run full integration tests with local validator
npm run test:integration

# Execute 100% security validation suite
./scripts/security-validation.sh
```
